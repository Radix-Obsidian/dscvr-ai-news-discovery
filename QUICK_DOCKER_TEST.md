# 🚀 Quick Docker App Test

## ✅ **Backend Status: WORKING**
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000 ✅
- Response: `{"message": "Welcome to Dscvr AI News Discovery Platform API", "docs": "/docs", "version": "1.0.0"}`

## ✅ **Docker Environment: WORKING**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001 ✅
- Environment variables: Set correctly ✅
- Supabase URL: Configured ✅

## 🎯 **Critical Test: Main App Functionality**

### **Step 1: Open Main App**
- Go to: http://localhost:3001
- **Expected**: Articles should load in the feed

### **Step 2: Test Article Detail (MOST IMPORTANT)**
- Click on any article in the feed
- **Expected**: Should open article detail view
- **Expected**: Should show real article content (not hardcoded text)

### **Step 3: Check Console**
- Open browser dev tools (F12)
- Check console for any red errors
- **Expected**: No critical errors

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- Articles appear in the feed
- Clicking articles opens detail view
- Article detail shows real content from Supabase
- No "column category does not exist" errors
- No hardcoded placeholder text

### **❌ Failure Indicators:**
- No articles load in feed
- Clicking articles shows hardcoded text
- Console shows database errors
- "Column category does not exist" errors

## 📊 **Test Results**

**Please report:**
1. Do articles load in the feed? (Yes/No)
2. When you click an article, do you see real content? (Yes/No)
3. Any console errors? (List them)
4. Does the app feel responsive? (Yes/No)

## 🔧 **If It's Still Broken**

If the main app still doesn't work:

1. **Check Console Errors**: Open dev tools and look for red errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed requests to Supabase
3. **Try Different Browser**: Test in incognito/private mode
4. **Check Docker Logs**: `docker-compose logs frontend`

**The CORS test failure is expected and doesn't affect the main app. The real test is the main app functionality!**
